                    <div class="title">Zoho website builder review</div>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>Zoho is the kind of website builder that makes it easy to grow with. You won‚Äôt need to upload your site to a new web host once it starts growing, there‚Äôs probably a plan you can upgrade to with all the features you need. All of the templates are super responsive, meaning they are easier to work with and self-explanatory. You can also customize each of the templates (which isn‚Äôt always the case for website builders). There‚Äôs an option that allows you to view page history, so you won‚Äôt 
                            lose part of your website just because you updated it. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Zoho templates include space to add audio, videos, photos that rotate, and even animations. Because of the design features, Zoho works great for anyone building an artistic website or for the creatives out there. Security is also great - Zoho has SSL Certificates and a password-protection feature. You‚Äôll feel better about who 
                            has access to edit your site and your users will be safe.</p>
                        <br></br>

                        <img src="../pics/zoho.png"; height="400px"; width="800px"; style="vertical-align:middle"><br> 
                        <br></br>
                        <p>Zoho comes with a free 15 day trial, but not an unlimited free option. You can still easily try Zoho without purchasing a plan and then cancel your trial if you decide it‚Äôs not the right fit. After the free trial, there‚Äôs two different plan options available. Here‚Äôs the info on features and prices for each: 
                            <br>
                            The Starter plan only costs $4.00 per month when you purchase the annual plan. This plan works great for small businesses and anyone who‚Äôs just starting to build a website. It includes up to five pages, 500 MB of storage, 10 GB of bandwidth per month, and up to five forms. For a plan that also includes a custom domain, this is relatively inexpensive. You‚Äôll also have an SSL Certificate, blogging capabilities, access to your own animation tool, and your site will be ad free. For a beginner‚Äôs plan, this includes everything you need to get started and make your website professional.  
                            <br>   
                            The Pro plan costs $15.00 per month when you pay annually. If you want to try this plan for your 15 day free trial, you can. There‚Äôs up to 50 pages, 100 GB of storage, unlimited bandwidth, and room for a 200 picture photo gallery. It also includes everything in the Starter plan such as the SSL Certificate. There‚Äôs a member portal where you can add up to two members to edit your site. This plan is great for websites that are larger and have more traffic to measure. 
                            <br>
                            There‚Äôs three separate add-ons you can purchase for the Pro plan in order to expand your website. Whenever your site is growing, you can just purchase an add-on. If you want to add up to 1,000 new members, it‚Äôs $50.00 per year. You can also purchase more pages (it‚Äôs $50.00 per year for each batch of 200 pages). If you want to add contributors, it‚Äôs $20.00 per user every year. </p>
